![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-green.svg)

Serverless Function Vulnerability Scanner is a Python script designed to scan serverless functions in cloud environments for security vulnerabilities.

## Features

- Scans AWS Lambda, Azure Functions, and other serverless functions.
- Detects vulnerabilities such as insecure dependencies, sensitive data exposure, and excessive permissions.
- Provides detailed reports with remediation recommendations.
- Supports multiple cloud providers.
- Integrates with CI/CD pipelines for automated scanning.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/serverless-vuln-scanner.git
   cd serverless-vuln-scanner
   
Install the required dependencies:

bash

    pip install -r requirements.txt

    Configure your cloud provider credentials:

    Set up your cloud provider credentials by following the instructions in the Configuration section.

Usage

Run the scanner with the following command:

bash

python serverless_scanner.py -f <function_name> -p <cloud_provider>

    -f or --function specifies the name of the serverless function to scan.
    -p or --provider specifies the cloud provider (e.g., aws, azure).

For example:

bash

python serverless_scanner.py -f my-function -p aws

Configuration

To configure your cloud provider credentials, create a .env file in the project root directory with the following format:

env

AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_aws_access_key_id
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_aws_secret_access_key

Replace your_aws_access_key_id and your_aws_secret_access_key with your actual credentials.
